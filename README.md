# MovieMatch - Group Movie Decision App

MovieMatch is a landing page for a web application that helps groups of people decide which movies to watch together. Inspired by dating apps, it uses a swiping interface to make group movie decisions fun and easy.

This repository also includes ElderConnect, a specialized application designed to connect elderly people through various activities.

## Design Concept

The app solves a common problem: groups of friends or family members spending more time arguing about what to watch than actually watching something. MovieMatch streamlines this process with:

1. **Create Groups**: Users can create groups and invite friends/family
2. **Swipe Movies**: Browse movie suggestions with an intuitive swiping interface
3. **Find Matches**: See which movies everyone liked
4. **Watch Together**: Settle on the perfect movie and enjoy your night

## ElderConnect Design Concept

ElderConnect is designed specifically for elderly users to connect through meaningful activities:

1. **Activity Categories**: Socialize & Have Fun, Physical & Mental Wellness, and Volunteering
2. **Personalized AI Recommendations**: Tailored activity suggestions based on interests and needs
3. **Event Management**: View upcoming and finished activities with integrated feedback
4. **Accessible Navigation**: Elder-friendly routing to event locations
5. **Community Features**: Rate volunteers and report issues to maintain quality
6. **Communication Tools**: Text/voice-supported chat for easy interaction
